For this assignment I decided to make a split screen in order to represent the information I wanted in the most clear way. On the left side, I have brought out the selected metadata points from the weather API. The json was long, so I decided to stop on 10 days, where from each of them I requested date, temperature, short weather forecast, and wind speed to be taken out of the API. I applied some styling to make the information more clean and readable.

On the right side of the screen I created a small chart, where each bar represents a day and night time temperature of each day that I'm getting the data from API. I really wanted to include two axes, x-axis that would represent the day and y-axis that would mark the temperature. Unfortunatelly, I struggled with it for a long time and couldn't figure it out since JavaScript got a little to complicated and my knowledge of it limited my abilities.
