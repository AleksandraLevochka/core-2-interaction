    <summary><u>Pronunciation</u></summary>
    (<b>US</b>: /ˈpɑːstə/, <b>UK</b>: /ˈpæstə/; <b>Italian</b>: [ˈpasta])
</details>

<p> --- is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of <a  href="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/63797959.cms"> wheat flour
</a> mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or other shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. <br>Rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils, are sometimes used in place of wheat flour to yield a different taste and texture, or as a gluten-free alternative. <br><i>Pasta is a staple food of Italian cuisine.</i></p>

<br>

<p><u>Pastas are divided into two broad categories:</u></p>
 <ul>
    <li>Dried pasta (pasta secca)</li>
    <li>fresh (pasta fresca)</li>
 </ul>   

<p> Most dried pasta is produced commercially via an extrusion process, although it can be produced at home. <br>Fresh pasta is traditionally produced by hand, sometimes with the aid of simple machines. Fresh pastas available in grocery stores are produced commercially by large-scale machines.</p>

<p>Both dried and fresh pastas come in a number of shapes and varieties, with 310 specific forms known by over 1,300 documented names. In Italy, the names of specific pasta shapes <br>or types often vary by locale. For example, the pasta form <em>cavatelli</em> is known by 28 different names depending upon the town and region. Common forms of pasta include long and <br>short shapes, tubes, flat shapes or sheets, miniature shapes for soup, those meant to be filled or stuffed, and specialty or decorative shapes.</p>

<br>

<p>As a category in Italian cuisine, both fresh and dried pastas are classically used in one of three kinds of prepared dishes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>As <em></em>pasta asciutta</em> (or <em>pastasciutta</em>)</li>
    <p>Cooked pasta is plated and served with a complementary sauce or condiment;</p>
    <li>A second classification of pasta dishes is <em>pasta in brodo</em></li>
    <p>The pasta is part of a soup-type dish</p>
    <li>A third category is <em>pasta al forno</em></li>
    <p>The pasta is incorporated into a dish that is subsequently baked in the oven</p>
</ul>

<p>Pasta dishes are generally simple, but individual dishes vary in preparation. Some pasta dishes are served as a small first course or for light lunches, such as pasta salads. <br>Other dishes may be portioned larger and used for dinner. Pasta sauces similarly may vary in taste, color and texture</p>

<p>In terms of nutrition, cooked plain pasta is 31% carbohydrates (mostly starch), 6% protein, and low in fat, with moderate amounts of manganese, but pasta generally has <br>low micronutrient content. Pasta may be enriched or fortified, or made from whole grains.</p>


<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>First attested in English in 1873, the word pasta comes from Italian pasta, in turn from Latin pasta, latinisation of the Greek παστά, pasta, 'barley porridge'.</p>
